## Specific warning about AINS / NILAM usage

This repository contains tools that automate discovery and generation of book metadata,
summaries and lessons for use with school reading-reporting systems (for example,
AINS/Advanced Integrated NILAM System). The software may produce summaries and
metadata enriched by third-party AI services (OpenAI) and third-party catalog APIs
(OpenLibrary).

**You must comply with your school’s rules and local laws.** The author of this
software:

- Is **not responsible** for any disciplinary action, academic consequences, or legal issues
  that arise from the use of this tool.
- **Does not** encourage plagiarism, academic dishonesty, or misrepresentation of any kind.
- Recommends using this software only for **educational, research, or authorized testing** purposes,
  or with explicit permission from the relevant institution.

## Data integrity and verification

Where the system fills missing metadata (publisher, ISBN), the software may rely on
third-party APIs or AI model outputs as a fallback. Any data produced by the AI fallback
should be verified before submission to official systems. The user is responsible for
verifying that metadata is accurate and acceptable to the target system.

## No endorsement

This tool is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any ministry, school,
or the owners/operators of AINS, NILAM, or any other third-party reading systems.
