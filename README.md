üîé What is AINS?
---
AINS is a digital platform created by the Ministry of Education Malaysia for students to digitally record and manage their reading activities within the NILAM program.Thus to complete a book,it required the infomation below:

- Title

- Author

- Publisher

- Book Type (Physical/Ebook)

- Category (Fiction/Non-Fiction)

- Summary (min. 10 words)

- Lesson (min. 5 words)
 
- Rating (1‚Äì5 stars)

This process is time-consuming, repetitive, and often demotivating for students who want to focus on real learning rather than bureaucratic logging.
